1. Refactor the build_annotation_csv and check_annot_dataframe functions into methods of the Dataset class
2. Find ways to make the subset dataset inherit the visualize method of the IntelDataset class
3. Add model config details - device, no.epochs, model name - as the trained model attribute (e.g., `details`) 
   and use it to append to exported model name for easy differentiation
